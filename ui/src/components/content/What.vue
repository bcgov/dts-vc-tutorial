        <h2>Verifiable Credentials are both new and familiar.</h2>
        <p>
          We are used to having physical things that identify ourselves, or
          prove something about ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>For example, we have drivers licenses, diplomas, and passports.</p>
        <p>They are called <strong>credentials</strong>.</p>
        <p>
          They work well in the physical world, but are not effective online.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is why a new technology is needed for taking credentials online.
          One that has been worked on for many years is
          <strong>Verifiable Credentials</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The technology behind Verifiable Credentials is new, but the ideas are
          much the same. You store them in a wallet, just a digital wallet. You
          show them to people, just using a smartphone rather than handing them
          over. They also have features that make them more secure and
          trustworthy than physical credentials.
