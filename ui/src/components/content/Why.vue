          A successful digital economy relies on people’s confidence in doing
          things online.
        </h2>
        <p>
          People need to be able to identify themselves to others reliably. They
          need to be confident they can share things securely and
          confidentially, and retain control over data that’s personal.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is why Verifiable Credentials are important. They are a new
          technology for trusting things online.
        </p>
        <p>
          The more Verifiable Credentials are used, the more effective they
          become at building an online environment where everyone is confident
          in data that’s accurate, authentic, and up-to-date. Organizations,
          governments and citizens all benefit.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this section we’ll explain how Verifiable Credentials could have a
          positive impact on our lives.
